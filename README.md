# Metropolitan-Area-Network-Simulation-
In this project, a wide area network simulation was created through Cisco Packet Tracer. It contains workstations, routers, necessary servers and necessary network devices. The necessary cable connections between these devices are defined on the simulation. In addition, it has been designed so that it can carry out e-mail sending, file transfer, IP phone, web and other necessary needs in simulation. The required configurations between any node and another node or server are completed on the simulation system, and the IP values are defined via DHCP. For servers, the process is static because the IPs must be given statically. There are a total of 5 campus simulations on two different campuses of a university and it contains servers and server farms.
